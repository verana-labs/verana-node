// ResolveCorporationByPolicyAddress implements AUTHZ-CHECK-5 (Corporation
// Registration check): it resolves the signing `corporation` account
// (= policy_address) to its registered Corporation entry. If no Corporation is
// bound to that policy_address it returns ErrCorporationNotRegistered, which
// references MOD-CO-MSG-1 and the offending policy_address. On success the
// resolved co.id is the corporation_id the calling message MUST use downstream.
//
// This is the single canonical resolver every delegable Msg routes through
// (directly for MOD-CO, or via a per-module CorporationKeeper adapter).
